| Feature / Aspect               | **ECS on EC2**                                                                           | **ECS on Fargate**                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Infrastructure Management**  | You manage the EC2 instances (cluster capacity, scaling, patching, etc.)                 | AWS manages the underlying compute — fully serverless container hosting                      |
| **Launch Type**                | EC2 Launch Type                                                                          | Fargate Launch Type                                                                          |
| **Control Over Host**          | Full control over EC2 instances (you can SSH, install agents, tweak OS settings)         | No access to underlying hosts — AWS abstracts infrastructure                                 |
| **Scaling**                    | You must handle instance scaling (Auto Scaling Groups, capacity providers, etc.)         | Automatically scales containers up/down — no manual instance scaling                         |
| **Billing Model**              | Pay for EC2 instances (even if idle)                                                     | Pay per vCPU and memory used by each running container                                       |
| **Performance**                | Suitable for long-running workloads and custom configurations                            | Ideal for short-lived, burst, or serverless workloads                                        |
| **Networking Mode**            | Supports both bridge, host, and awsvpc modes                                             | Supports only **awsvpc** (each task gets its own ENI and IP)                                 |
| **Setup Complexity**           | More complex — need to provision, patch, and secure EC2 instances                        | Simpler — AWS handles all infrastructure                                                     |
| **Use Cases**                  | - When you need custom AMIs<br>- GPU workloads<br>- Tight control over networking and OS | - When you want zero infrastructure management<br>- Microservices, APIs, and CI/CD pipelines |
| **Startup Time**               | Slower (depends on EC2 provisioning)                                                     | Faster — Fargate tasks start in seconds                                                      |
| **Maintenance Responsibility** | You (update AMIs, apply security patches, manage scaling groups)                         | AWS (fully managed)                                                                          |
| **Capacity Provider**          | ECS EC2 capacity provider or Auto Scaling Group                                          | Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity provider                                                    |
| **Logging & Monitoring**       | Need to configure CloudWatch, agents, and log drivers manually                           | Simplified logging — integrates easily with CloudWatch                                       |
| **Spot Pricing**               | Supports EC2 Spot Instances (for cost optimization)                                      | Supports **Fargate Spot** (up to 70% cheaper)                                                |
| **Use Case Example**           | Long-running container workloads (e.g., Jenkins, monitoring agents)                      | Stateless apps, REST APIs, and serverless microservices                                      |
| **Ideal For**                  | Teams that need deep control and optimization of infrastructure                          | Teams that prefer simplicity and serverless operations                                       |
